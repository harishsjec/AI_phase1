###- House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using machine learning techniques. The model is designed to assist real estate agents, property buyers, and sellers in making informed decisions.

Dataset Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vedavyasv/usa-housing]. It contains various features related to houses, such as size, location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, amenities, neighborhood details, and other relevant information. Additional data, such as market trends, interest rates, and economic indicators, may also be included to enhance the model's predictive power.
